"""Structured inner-loop trajectory: status.jsonl (machine SSOT) + Layer-1 digest.

Each iteration appends one IterationRecord. The record holds OBJECTIVE facts only
— the optimization technique applied and the measured outcome (correctness, perf,
NCU) — for BOTH kept and reverted iterations. The inner agent's SUBJECTIVE analysis
(why it expected a gain, its bottleneck theory) is deliberately NOT recorded, so
the meta agent diagnoses from measured hardware truth rather than the student's
prose. build_digest() assembles the operator-agnostic Layer-1 digest (design §4.1bis).
