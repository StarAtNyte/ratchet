"""No reference to distil from: generate one with a ``/goal`` session, then run as usual.

A source-mode run distils its milestone from an oracle — the source of a kernel that already
does what the student is asked to reproduce. A card that has none (a leaderboard card
scaffolded without ``--sealed-ref`` / ``--binary-ref``, a hand-made card whose loop.toml
names no ``oracle``) had nothing to distil from: ``_has_distillation_input`` said no, the
teacher never ran, and the student started against whatever milestone was on disk — on a
fresh card, none. This module closes that gap the way a source reference is often written by
hand: an interactive ``claude`` driven by ``/goal`` writes the kernel from scratch on the
card's own harness, the harness (not the agent) picks and re-measures the best correct
version, and that version becomes the run's oracle (source mode). From there the loop is
unchanged: the teacher distils milestone v1 from it, the student starts from the card's
stub as in every source-mode run.

When it runs (``[loop] ref_from_goal`` / ``--ref-from-goal``):

  auto    (default) oracle_mode is "source", no oracle is declared, and no valid
          milestone is on disk. A blackbox run has its sealed reference, oracle_mode
          "none" asked not to distil, and a milestone on disk is the run's input.
  always  every source-mode run, a declared oracle notwithstanding (it is ignored).
  off     never; the run behaves as before this module existed.

Whatever the setting, a reference this operator directory already generated is reused
(``goal_ref/state.json`` status "accepted"), a generation the loop was interrupted in is
resumed, and one that failed refuses the launch until the operator removes
``goal_ref/`` or turns the setting off.

How the session measures. The agent never submits GPU work itself — the student does not
either; the driver does. Its evaluation command (``python -m forgekernel.loop.goal_ref
eval``) only snapshots the kernel file into a request directory inside its workspace and
waits; the loop process, outside the agent's sandbox, serves the request: it copies the
snapshot into a submission tree of its own (``operators/_<op>goalref``, a clone of the
card: the card's gpu_entry.sh and eval/, so the verdict is the card's), submits the
card's ``all`` task through ``RealBackend.submit_gpu`` (a lost runner, clock-lock
refusals as for every FK job), parses the eval JSON
with the driver's own ``parse_eval`` and appends the reading to a ledger the agent cannot
write. The answer it writes back ends in a machine line the ``/goal`` condition refers to
(``FK_GOALREF_RESULT`` / ``FK_GOALREF_DONE`` / ``FK_GOALREF_DEADLINE_PASSED``), and the
session's deliverable check (``goal_ref check``) reads the ledger, never the agent's text.

What counts. A candidate is eligible when the card judged it correct (and, with the
precision gate merged, its contract did not fail it) and its source calls no kernel
library for the computation (``library_findings``: a reference that is a flashinfer call
has nothing to distil). The speed bar (``resolve_bar``) is the first of: --target-ms, the
architecture reference the card declares (a SOL card's T_b), the in-job reference the
bench times beside the kernel (same-job ratio >= ``ref_from_goal_ratio``), an archived
library baseline; with none of them there is no bar and the session runs to its
deadline. The session ends at the bar or at the deadline (``ref_from_goal_hours`` after
it started, absolute: a resumed session does not get a fresh budget), plus
``Generation.report_s`` past the deadline to write its report and run the check; then
the eligible candidates are re-measured by the loop, fastest
first, ``ref_from_goal_accept_runs`` times each, and the first that stays correct in every
run is the reference. No eligible candidate — or none that survives — fails the launch
(EXIT_GOAL_REF_FAILED); a wrong kernel is never made an oracle.

What the loop gets (``apply``): ``oracle`` = the accepted kernel (and the session's
report beside it), ``oracle_mode`` = "source", ``kb_lint_oracle_tokens`` = false unless
loop.toml says otherwise (the generated kernel may use the KB's helper names), and the
acceptance reading declared as the architecture reference (the target) when it is
the fastest known reference: faster than an architecture reference the card declares as
constants (a SOL card's T_b) and not slower than the same-job library reference
(``arch_decision``). A measured architecture reference and --target-ms always win.

Layout, all under ``operators/<op>/goal_ref/`` (git-excluded from the card; denied to the
student as a teacher-only tree):

  state.json      status, deadline, bar, attempts, the accepted candidate and readings
  ledger.jsonl    one row per evaluation (and per acceptance run)
  candidates/NNN  the kernel each evaluation judged, its job log and readings
  acceptance/     the acceptance runs' logs
  reference/      the oracle: the accepted kernel file + NOTES.md (the session's report)
  session/        TASK.md as given, the agent's stdout/stderr per attempt, transcripts
  ws/             the agent's working directory (a clone of the card)

This run has no reference implementation to distill from. The kernel you write becomes this
run's **reference (oracle)**: the teacher reads its source to distill the milestone, and its
measured speed may also become the student's target. So it must be **correct**, and it must be
**fast**.

## Deliverable
- The current directory `{ws}` is a copy of this operator tree. Write the implementation into
  `{kernel_file}`; the entry point, signature, inputs/outputs and the DPS convention are in
  {files} (the reference in the definition is the standard of correctness).
- Language: {lang_line}.
- **The main computation must be done by a kernel you write yourself**: do not call existing
  operator libraries (flashinfer, cuBLAS / cuDNN, torch's matmul / attention / normalization /
  softmax and other compute functions and `@`, torch.ops, vllm, sgl_kernel, deep_gemm,
  flash_attn ...); use torch only for allocation, views and dtype conversion. The evaluator scans
  the source, and a candidate that hits one is not counted (marked NOT ELIGIBLE).
- The evaluator takes only `{kernel_file}`: `eval/`, `gpu_entry.sh` and the other evaluator files
  are always the operator tree's own; changing them has no effect.

## How to measure (the only GPU channel; this machine has no GPU)
- `{ev}`
  Hands the current `{kernel_file}` to this operator tree's official evaluator (correctness +
  timing, exactly what the student is judged by), prints correctness, the reading, whether the
  speed bar is met and the current best, and a last line `{RESULT_LINE} ...`; when the bar is
  met there is an extra line `{DONE_LINE}`, and past the deadline `{DEADLINE_LINE}`. One run
  takes a few minutes (queueing not included). The command waits at most 18 minutes; if the
  result has not arrived it prints `{PENDING_LINE}` and the command to keep waiting. Use it
  serially, and give Bash a generous timeout (e.g. 1200000 ms).
- `{ex}`
  Runs any command (NCU, probe scripts) on a GPU node, in a copy of "this operator tree + your
  current `{kernel_file}` + the `./probes/` directory". It does not judge correctness and does
  not count as a candidate; put probes in `./probes/` (≤256 KiB).
- `{st}`: uses no GPU; lists each candidate's correctness, reading and whether it met the bar.

## Speed bar
{bar['text']}.

## Deadline
**{_stamp(deadline)}** (budget {hours:g} hours). If the bar is not met, keep improving until the
deadline; do not stop early. After the deadline the harness takes the candidate that is
"correct, free of library calls and fastest", and re-measures it itself for acceptance; if no
candidate qualifies, this step fails.

## Finishing
Once you see `{DONE_LINE}`, or the deadline has passed: write the report into `{reply}` — the
final design (data flow, tiling, pipelining, synchronization), why it is fast (cite measured
readings), what you tried that did not help, and known limitations; then run `{ck}`. It is done
only when that prints `{OK_LINE}`. After the deadline you have {report_s / 60:.0f} more minutes
to write the report and run check (no evaluations are accepted during that time); then the
session is ended.

## Working rules
- Measure before you change: where the bottleneck is and what the reachable floor is (an empty
  kernel's launch overhead; the bytes that must move, at measured bandwidth).
- One measurement does not count; when a difference is under a few percent, confirm it with
  repeated evaluations.
- Correctness first: a correct slow kernel is more useful than a fast wrong one.{reads}
