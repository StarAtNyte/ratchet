"""What a headless agent may reach from the machine it runs on: the network, and the
reference implementation's source.

The rules this module enforces:

- the **student** never goes online (no WebFetch / WebSearch, no outbound traffic from
  its shell) and never reads the reference source or a teacher-only tree;
- the **teacher** may go online, but in a closed-source (blackbox) run it may read the
  reference source neither on this machine nor on the web.

Until this existed both rules were prompt text only. Agents run as ``claude -p
--dangerously-skip-permissions`` on the host, so nothing stopped them: an audit of earlier
runs' agent transcripts found students fetching public implementations of the very
operator they were building and adapting them into kernel.py, which is exactly the
dependence a blackbox run is meant to measure the absence of.

Enforcement is delivered as a Claude Code *project* settings file written into the
agent's working directory right before each turn (``<cwd>/.claude/settings.json``):

- a project file reaches every way the agent is launched -- an absolute ``claude`` path,
  a wrapper script, ``--setting-sources project`` -- where a
  ``--settings`` flag or a ``claude`` shim on PATH would each miss some of them, and
  ``CLAUDE_CODE_MANAGED_SETTINGS_PATH`` is not honoured by the builds in use;
- ``permissions.deny`` removes WebFetch / WebSearch and refuses the file tools (and the
  shell readers Claude Code recognises) on the forbidden trees; deny rules hold under
  ``--dangerously-skip-permissions`` and inside subagents. A ``Read`` deny rule is what
  the file tools are checked against -- it covers Edit and Write on the same path and is
  applied best-effort to Grep and Glob, while a ``Glob(path)`` or ``Write(path)`` rule is
  accepted, never consulted, and warned about at startup;
- the Bash **sandbox** (Seatbelt on macOS) is what makes it hard: ``filesystem.denyRead``
  stops ``python3 -c "open(...)"`` as well as ``cat``, and the network layer refuses
  every outbound connection from the student's shell. Three things are needed there,
  because each alone has a hole: ``deniedDomains = ["*"]`` (an ``allowedDomains = []``
  alone only turns an unlisted host into a permission prompt, which bypass mode
  approves), the ``WebFetch(domain:*)`` deny rule (documented to leave sandboxed
  commands unable to reach any host, and honoured from project settings, which
  ``strictAllowlist`` is NOT -- it is read from user, managed and ``--settings``
  settings only), and ``failIfUnavailable`` so that a sandbox that cannot start stops
  the agent instead of silently running it unsandboxed;
- a PreToolUse **hook** is the last layer: it refuses a student's network-shaped shell
  commands, and refuses teacher tool calls that name a declared reference repository.
  It is a tripwire, not a boundary -- a fetch that never spells the repository out
  (a URL shortener, a vendored mirror, a script that builds the URL at runtime) walks
  past it, and only the closed-source teacher, which keeps the network on purpose,
  depends on it at all;
- writes are scoped per role: the teacher may write the run's repository (milestones,
  KB recipes), the student only its own working directory, so a turn cannot edit the
  prompts, the knowledge base or this policy's own hook script;
- the sandbox also refuses writes to the settings files themselves, and the file is
  rewritten from this module before every turn, so an edit could not outlive the turn.

Each turn's prompt is prefixed with a short notice of the same rules, so the agent does
not spend its turn discovering them by failure.
