"""Accounting for the main-repo artifacts nothing commits.

The teacher writes two things into the *main* repo working tree: a certified
`hw_kb/` recipe (G3) and the per-op milestone (distill/patch). Every git call
the driver makes is scoped to the student workspace (``RealBackend`` runs
``git -C <workspace>``), so neither is ever committed — a recipe survives only
as a dirty file, and an unattended run drops it the moment someone checks out
another branch in that clone.

Two guards, both cheap:

- refuse to start on an unharvested ``hw_kb`` — otherwise a second run stacks
  its recipes on top of the first one's and the pile gets harder to review;
- report what is left behind when the run ends, with the absolute repo root,
  since ``_repo_root()`` follows the installed package rather than the cwd and
  the tree that received the recipes is not always the one being watched.

The trajectory files (``status.jsonl`` / ``meta_status.jsonl``) are deliberately
out of scope: the loop appends to them every iteration, so they are always dirty
and would drown the signal.
