#
#   bash agent-claude.sh <model> [effort] [timeout_s]
#     prompt on stdin, reply on stdout.
#
# A turn is `claude -p` under a wall-clock timeout: `claude -p` has none of its own, and a
# stream that opens and then never delivers its last frame would hang the run with it.
# A caller that needs a /goal session (loop/goal_ref.py, when a task has no reference)
# sets FK_AGENT_DRIVER=goal; the turn is then an interactive claude driven by /goal
# (scripts/claude-goal.sh), with the same model and arguments.
#
# Credentials come from the environment (local.env): ANTHROPIC_API_KEY or
# CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN, or the CLI's own login (provider = "native"). Another provider
# (global_config/backends.toml) sets ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL and FK_PROVIDER_KEY_ENV, the name of
# the variable that holds its key.
